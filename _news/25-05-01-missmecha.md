We are excited to officially announce the **first public release** of the **MissMecha** Python package! ðŸŽ‰

MissMecha is an open-source toolkit for **simulating, analyzing, and evaluating missing data mechanisms** (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) in **Python**. It is designed to help data scientists, researchers, and educators better understand how missingness impacts their data and models.

Key features include:

- âœ… Flexible missing data generation (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)  
- âœ… Easy-to-use `MissMechaGenerator` with sklearn-style API  
- âœ… Built-in evaluation metrics for imputation quality  
- âœ… Visualization tools for missingness patterns  
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation and examples

You can explore the package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/missmecha-py/), or check out the [official documentation](https://echoid.github.io/missmecha-docs/).

```bash
pip install missmecha-py
````

### Why MissMecha?

Handling missing data is critical in real-world applications, but it's often oversimplified. MissMecha makes it easy to **generate controlled missingness patterns** for benchmarking, **evaluate imputation methods**, and **gain insights into data reliability**.


We invite you to try MissMecha, provide feedback, and contribute to its ongoing development.
Letâ€™s make missing data research more **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **accessible** for all.
