Iâ€™m **Youran (Echo) Zhou**, a data scientist, educator, and researcher specializing in **missing data**, **generative modeling**, and **applied machine learning**. My work focuses on developing robust tools and methods to improve data quality and enable reliable analysis across real-world domains such as healthcare, insurance, and finance.

With over five years of teaching and mentoring experience in data science, AI, and analytics, I am passionate about making complex methods accessible to diverse learners. I have taught and supported students from undergraduate to postgraduate levels and actively contribute as a lecturer, tutor, and academic mentor My goal is to empower future data scientists through practical, inclusive, and research-informed learning experiences.

As a researcher, I develop open-source solutions for handling incomplete data, including simulation, visualization, and imputation evaluation. My work bridges theory and practice, supporting both academic research and real-world data science applications.

Currently, I am completing my PhD in Data Science at Deakin University, focusing on advancing methods for missing data imputation, diagnostics, and simulation. I am excited to continue contributing to **teaching**, **research**, and **industry collaboration** in data science and AI.
