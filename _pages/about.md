## About me

I’m **Youran (Echo) Zhou**, a data scientist and researcher specializing in missing data, generative modeling, and applied machine learning.  
I design robust tools and methods to improve data quality and analysis in real-world environments, with applications across health, insurance, and finance.

With over five years of experience in machine learning, data analytics, and AI education, I actively contribute as a **lecturer, tutor, and mentor**—helping bridge technical insight with accessible learning.  
I'm especially passionate about building open tools, guiding future data scientists, and translating advanced methods into impactful solutions.

Currently, I am completing my PhD in Data Science at Deakin University, where I focus on developing advanced techniques for missing data imputation, diagnostics, and simulation.
