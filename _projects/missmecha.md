MissMecha is an open-source Python package designed for researchers and practitioners to simulate, visualize, and evaluate missing data mechanisms, including MCAR, MAR, and MNAR.

With MissMecha, you can generate controlled missing patterns, evaluate imputation methods, and explore the impact of different missing data types on your downstream models. It provides a unified API for simulation, imputation, and evaluation — making it a complete toolkit for incomplete data research.
